# Rocky jump
side scrolling runner game in python,
code could be way better but this is the first and probably last time I use PyGame :-) . <br/>
HOW TO PLAY :<br/>
execute game.py<br/>
after dying it will demand your name in the terminal<br/>
if you want to see the leaderboard execute leaderboard.py<br/>
